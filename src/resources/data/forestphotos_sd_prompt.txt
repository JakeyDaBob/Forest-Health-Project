Can you provide me with 4 prompts for an image of inside a forest for Stable Diffusion XL. The image should be photorealistic and look like it was taken from a mobile phone / non professional camera. 
This image is from the Lamington National Park Australia

Each prompt should randomly have:
- Time of day, any daylight hour is allowed. Just not something that will make the image too dark
- Camera Angle: High angle, Low angle, Eye level, Floor level
- Different weather conditions: Clear, Rainy, Foggy

Each prompt should have varying random:
- Landscape Position/Type: Flat, Hill, Slope, Valley
- Vegeation Type: EucalyptForestFernOrHerb, EucalyptForestGrassy, EucalyptForestShrubby, Rainforest, Riparian
- Vegetation Development Stage: Old, Mature, Regrowth, Mixed, Few trees
- Fire Burn Severity: Unburnt, Low, Moderate, High, Exetreme
- Flowering Plants: Some, Plenty, None

Have a chance of a random forest animal being in the image:
- This animal shouldn't be the main focus of the image
- And should instead be slightly obstructed

When you decided on a random event for the image. Don't specify that it should be a small chance in the prompt.
Simply either add the random event to the prompt or don't add it at all
This goes for the main prompt and the negative prompt

You are allowed to specify the following for settings:
- CFG Values
- Negative Prompt

Make sure that the leaves are not noisy

Use your knowledge of the mentioned forest to add further accuracy to the prompt

To make sure the image is realisitc. Add a subtle depth of field so somethings aren't in focus

I understand this raw scientific explaination of the data will not create a good image if it were a prompt
Transform this information so it will work nicely with stable diffusion
